# project-one-tictactoe
This code was created as part of the capstone project for Codecademys 'CS101: Introduction to Programming'. 
You can read about my learnings of doing this project on medium.
The objective was to create:

- Use each of the following : List, Dictionary,  Function & Class object
- Have a fully 'functional' end-to-end game inclusive of:
- A visible game board throughout the game 
- A function to declare the winner / draw 
- Appropriate error handling when incorrect, or illegal, moves are made
